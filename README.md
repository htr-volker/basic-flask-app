# Docker-Contained Flask Web App

This is a basic dockerised flask web app. It requires the creation of a .env file to be built in order to run containing the following environment variables for the SQL database instance you want it to connect to:
* MYSQL_USER
* MSQL_PASSWORD
* MYSQL_URL
* MYSQL_DATABASE
* MYSQL_SECRETKEY

Otherwise it ought to work out of the box.
